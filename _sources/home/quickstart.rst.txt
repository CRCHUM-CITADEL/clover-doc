Quickstart
==========

To get started, we created 4 notebooks to guide you through the generation of synthetic data, their associated utility and privacy reports and the hyperparameters tuning.

- `Synthetic data generation <../tutorial/synthetic_data_generation.nblink>`_
- `Utility report <../tutorial/utility_report.nblink>`_
- `Privacy report <../tutorial/privacy_report.nblink>`_
- `Tune hyperparameters <../tutorial/tune_hyperparameters.nblink>`_

To get the average summary metrics results for both utility and privacy at once, see the `combined report <../tutorial/combined_report.nblink>`_ notebook.

To compare several synthetic datasets with respect to a list of metrics, see the `metareport <../tutorial/metareport.nblink>`_ notebook.

The notebooks are based on the `Breast Wisconsin Cancer WBCD dataset
<https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Original%29>`_.

The original notebooks can be found in the
`notebooks/ <https://github.com/CRCHUM-CITADEL/clover/tree/main/notebooks>`_ folder on Github.
