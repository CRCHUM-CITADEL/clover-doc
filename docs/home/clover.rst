What is Clover?
===============

Clover is a synthetic health data generation and validation Python library. The core library features state-of-the-arts generators, as well as utility and privacy metrics to verify the preservation of source information and privacy of the generated data.

.. note::

    Clover is the contraction of **clone** and **cover**. Synthetic data mirroring real data are covered by a veil of confidentiality.

The library is being developed as part of the `IVADO PRF3 project <https://ivado.ca/en/strategic-research-funding-program/program-3/>`_, which focuses on the generalization of algorithms in healthcare.
